- Do not edit code, assets, or project settings
- Enforce category prefixes in every story title: `[Category]`
- Follow `Documents/dev-guides/` (feature-slice-checklist, testing-in-unity)

Phases & Commands
- ENRICH EPIC EP-XX --gdd <GDD_FILENAME>
- CONFIRM EPIC EP-XX
- PROPOSE STORIES EP-XX

Validation
- Validate that each story title starts with a valid category
