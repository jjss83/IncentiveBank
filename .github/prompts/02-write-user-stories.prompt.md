4) Confirm the story listREQUIRED CONTEXT

Before beginning any phase, the user MUST specify:

5) Flesh out each story's full content- The target Epic ID (e.g., EP-00, EP-01)

- The GDD reference to use (e.g., GDDv1.1.md, specify exact filename and version)

6) Confirm and add Tasks with types, estimates, and acceptance criteria
